# UO Campus Belonging    

The University of Oregon has a sprawling campus with a diverse student population. Students interact with campus through their time in different buildings, taking classes, and meeting with friends. 
Through this experience students develop a sense of belonging to places on campus. 
These maps asked students to identify where they felt the greatest sense of belonging as well as where they did not feel a sense of belonging.  
The maps are divided by student type (undergraduate, international, and graduate students) as well as the year the data was collected.
Some maps also contain disaggregated data for the responding student cohort or graduating year. Below you can find maps that show both sentiments. 

More on the methods can be found at the bottom of the page.
