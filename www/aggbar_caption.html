<p><b>Inclusiveness</b> is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by:</p>

<p>
    <i>n</i> Belong / (<i>n</i> Belong + <i>n</i> Don't Belong) * 100.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Yellow</b> represents the high end of the inclusiveness continuum, and <b>Dark Purple</b> represents the low end.
    Color mapping to inclusiveness percentages follows the treemaps in the 'Disaggregated and Less Delimited' section
    and is thus variable across plots.
</p>

<p>
    <b>'Aggregated'</b> = Some individual places were combined into larger places
    (e.g., residence halls into University Housing).
</p>

<p>
    <b>'More Delimited'</b> = The criterion for inclusion of a place in a plot was
    &ge; 0.1 of the total proportion of clicks, where total proportion of clicks
    was defined as the total number of clicks on a place divided by the
    average of the total number of clicks across all places.
    This is a stricter criterion than that used in 'Less Delimited.'
</p>

<p>Clicks on Lawn, Other, and Out of Bounds regions were omitted before computing the total proportion of clicks.</p>
