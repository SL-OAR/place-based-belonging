<p><b>Note:</b> The donut plots are generated from the student responses to the question, "Why did you select that location?"</p>

<p>As part of the survey, students first selected the locations they felt the greatest sense of belonging and the least sense of belonging.</p>

<p>After selecting locations students were asked why they selected those locations. The responses were then analyzed to uncover the key sentiments around words that were associated with greater sense of belonging and less sense of belonging.</p>

<p>These plots, which are dividied into responses by building, are the <b>top 10</b> word responses from the students.</p>

<p>The words may not always be relevant on their own due to the responses from students to "Why this location?" taking the form of a multiword sentence. 
The data for the plots are words from sentence responses that were split and extracted for this daataset. Junk words such as "the, they, at, etc." were removed as well as the building names and nicknames.</p>

<p>Text data were annotated using the <code>udpipe</code> package.</p>

<p>Keywords were extracted using the <b>Rapid Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm</b>
