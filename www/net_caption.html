<p>If a word seems negatively valenced, it was very likely negated (e.g., preceded by the word "not").</p>

US undergraduates of all years/cohorts (mostly 1st-through-4th-year and predominantly first-year) 
contributed data in <code>r ayrs_cam</code>. Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, 
some students contributed data more than once.</p>

aggregated into superordinate places and then disaggregated by subordinate places</span> 
(i.e., not Erb Memorial Union, Lokey Science Complex, or University Housing) 
<span style="color: #11E8FF; font-weight: bold;">as well as across sentiments</span> 
(i.e., "belong" and "don't belong"), most students contributed to only one wave of data collection.</p>

<p>Text data were annotated using the <code>udpipe</code> package.</p>

<p>Wordnet was generated using the <code>ggraph</code> and <code>igraph</code> packages.</p>

<p>Colors were produced using the <code>rocket</code> palette of the <code>viridis</code> package.</p>
