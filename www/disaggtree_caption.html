<p>
  <b>Note:</b> Rectangle <span style="color: #FEE11A ">size</span> represents a place's overall 
  <span style="color: #FEE11A ">popularity</span>, computed by <i>n</i> Belong + <i>n</i> Don't Belong.
</p>
<p>
  Rectangle <span style="color: #FEE11A ">color</span> represents a place's 
  <span style="color: #FEE11A ">inclusiveness</span>, which is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is:
  <br>
  <i>n</i> Belong / (<i>n</i> Belong + <i>n</i> Don't Belong) * 100.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Yellow</b> represents the high end of the inclusiveness continuum, and <b>black</b> represents the low end. 
  <span style="color: gray;">Gray text</span> represents inclusiveness &gt; 75%.
</p>
<p>
  <b>'Disaggregated'</b> = Nothing was done to combine individual places into larger places 
  (e.g., residence halls into University Housing).
</p>
<p>
  <b>'Less Delimited'</b> = The criterion for inclusion in a treemap was a total click count of at least 20, 
  which is less restrictive than the criterion used in 'More Delimited.'
</p>
<p>
  The criterion for presenting a treemap was at least 4 places represented. Additionally, all treemaps omit 
  clicks on Lawn, Other, and Out of Bounds regions.
</p>
<p>
  Some names of places with lower popularity were abbreviated to fit the text in their respective rectangles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>TF</b></span> = Turf Field</li>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>DS</b></span> = Duck Store</li>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>Barn</b></span> = Outdoor Program Barn</li>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>Cas</b></span> = Cascade</li>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>FAS</b></span> = Fine Art Studios</li>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>MNL</b></span> = Many Nations Longhouse</li>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>MS</b></span> = LERC Military Science</li>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>MNCH</b></span> = Museum of Natural and Cultural History</li>
  <li><span style="color: #FEE11A "><b>Moss</b></span> = Moss Street Children's Center</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years, 
  and because both places and methods have changed over time, 
  there is some inaccuracy in representing popularity and inclusiveness.

  <b>Spring 2022:</b> Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year 
  (i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data.
