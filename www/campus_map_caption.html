spectrum represents a continuum from more to fewer clicks on a place, given total number of clicks. 
Number of clicks on a place &ge; 20 are displayed.</p>

<p>Color saturation and area of blobs are dependent on concentration in a general area, irrespective of 
regions drawn on a map, which can sometimes be inconsistent with quantification based on clicks in map regions.</p>

<p><b>"All Years"</b> = Mostly first-year, second-year, third-year, fourth-year, and fifth-year 
(i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, 
along with a few <i>n-year</i> students (i.e., a few from 2002-03, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) 
and US exchange undergraduates.</p>

<p>Heat maps were originally produced in Qualtrics (30px radius, 35px blur), and click counts were overlaid on the heat map image 
using the <code>magick</code> package. These are images of the maps created.</p>
