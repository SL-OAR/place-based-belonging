<p><b>Note:</b> Emotions are presented in rank order from most to least prevalent.</p>

<p><b>Percentage</b> = the percentage of all eligible words classified as being representative of one of eight emotions
(anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust), based on
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/053901882021004003" target="_blank" style="color: #489D46;">Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of emotion</a>
(<a href="#f1" style="color: #489D46;">Figure 1</a>).</p>

<p>The threshold for the minimum number of responses was 20.</p>

<p>Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once.</p>

<p><span style="color: #FEE11A; font-weight: bold;">Across all places that were not subsequently aggregated into superordinate places
and then disaggregated by subordinate places</span> (i.e., not Erb Memorial Union, Lokey Science Complex, or University Housing)
<span style="color: #FEE11A; font-weight: bold;">as well as across sentiments</span> (i.e., "belong" and "don't belong"),
most students contributed to only one wave of data collection, relatively few students contributed to two waves,
and no one contributed to three waves.</p>

<p>The <code>nrc</code> lexicon
(<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6297.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #489D46;">Mohammad & Turney, 2013</a>)
was used to classify emotional content.</p>

<p>Bar plot was generated using the <code>ggplot2</code> package.</p>

<p>Colors were produced using the <code>rocket</code> palette of the <code>viridis</code> package.</p>
