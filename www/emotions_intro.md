# "Why There?" Word Sentiment Analysis 

## Word Emotions  
Words can convey our emotional feeling toward a place. 
For example, some students described the cemetery on campus as creepy, scary, or spooky, while others used the words quiet and peaceful. 
This analysis uses the words from the previous tab and assigns eligible words to a classification of one of eight emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust),
based on Plutchik's psychoevolutionary theory of emotion. 
The percentage of words belonging to each category by location is what is plotted below to give a general sense of the emotions around different places on campus. 
Data is again split by responses that were a result of a student selecting a places they felt a sense of belonging and place they lacked a sense of belonging. 
More information about the methods can be found below.
