# Exploring **Place-Based Belonging**  

This dashboard explores the idea of **place-based belonging**, or the notion that  
> *"people’s affinity for physical places, or lack thereof, is intertwined with their sense of whether or not they fit socially"* (**Clark & Malham, 2019**).  

The **procedure** underlying this exploration involves asking students to **identify places on a campus map** where they feel:  

- **A sense of belonging** (*places where they feel connected, accepted, and like they fit in*).  
- **A sense of not belonging** (*places where they feel disconnected, unaccepted, or like they do not fit in*).  

Students participate by **clicking on respective locations** on an interactive campus map, providing valuable insight into the spatial dynamics of belonging on campus.

## **How We Use These Responses**  

To **visualize and analyze** student responses, we employed a variety of analytical and graphical techniques:  

- **<span class="yellow-text">Heat maps</span>** → Visually represent areas of high and low belongingness across campus.  
- **<span class="yellow-text">Tree maps</span>** → Highlight the overall popularity of different locations.  
- **<span class="yellow-text">Wordnets & Wordclouds</span>** → Capture the sentiments and language students use to describe their experiences in various places.  
- **<span class="yellow-text">Bar graphs</span>** → Quantify student free responses, showing trends in emotions and perceptions tied to specific locations.  

These tools allow us to **identify patterns**, compare differences between student groups, and explore how campus spaces influence a sense of belonging.
