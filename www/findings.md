# Full Project Highlights  

## Places (Overall, not broken down by year unless specified)  

- Overall, undergraduate students most frequently report feeling a sense of belonging in the **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Erb Memorial Union (EMU)</span>**, with the *Fishbowl* being one of the most frequented locations.  

- The only two **University Housing** locations where the number of students who report feeling like they **don’t belong** is larger than those who report that they do are in places typically for graduate housing:  
  - **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Spencer View</span>** (*17 belong, 54 not belong*)  
  - **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Grad Village</span>** (*1 belong, 16 not belong*)  

- Apart from the **EMU**, the **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Student Recreation Complex</span>** (*N = 896*) and the **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Knight Library</span>** (*N = 839*) rank second and third for student belonging. However, while the **Student Recreation Center** reports a high sense of belonging (*N = 828*), it also reports a relatively high sense of *not* belonging (*N = 733*).  

- **International students** most reported feeling a sense of belonging in the **EMU**, particularly the **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Mills International Center</span>** (*N = 22*). Apart from EMU-specific places, **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Allen</span>** was the second-most selected location for a sense of belonging (*N = 7*).  

- Graduate students most reported feeling a sense of belonging in the **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">cemetery</span>** (*N = 10*).

## Defining Inclusiveness  

- We define **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">inclusiveness</span>** as when the *"belong"* count is high and the *"don’t belong"* count is low.  
- Because we ask students to identify places where they feel like they do and do not belong, another way of rank-ordering places is in terms of their overall inclusiveness.  
- That is, a place is **inclusive** to the extent that its *“belong”* click count is **high** and its *“don’t belong”* click count is **low**.

## Most Inclusive Locations  

- Considering the **percent of “belong” clicks** out of total clicks for the top six places with the most total clicks:  
  - **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Erb Memorial Union (EMU)</span>** was by far the most **inclusive** (*Table 2*).  
  - **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Knight Library</span>** ranked second and remained *solidly* inclusive.  
  - **University Housing** was *mostly* inclusive.  
  - **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Lokey Science Complex</span>** and the **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Student Recreation Center</span>** were *split* between belonging and not belonging.  
  - **<span style="background-color: #FFFF99;">Lillis Business Complex</span>** was **not** very inclusive.
