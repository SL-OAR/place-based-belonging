# Full Project Highlights  

## Places (Overall, not broken down by year unless specified)  

- Overall, undergraduate students most frequently report feeling a sense of belonging in the [Erb Memorial Union (EMU)](https://emu.uoregon.edu/), with the *Fishbowl* being one of the most frequented locations.  

- The only two **University Housing** locations where the number of students who report feeling like they **don’t belong** is larger than those who report that they do are in places typically for graduate housing:  
  - [Spencer View](https://apartments.uoregon.edu/spencerview) (*17 belong, 54 not belong*)  
  - [Grad Village](https://apartments.uoregon.edu/graduatevillage) (*1 belong, 16 not belong*)  

- Apart from the **EMU**, the [Student Recreation Complex](https://emu.uoregon.edu/) (*N = 896*) and the [Knight Library](https://library.uoregon.edu/knight) (*N = 839*) rank second and third for student belonging. However, while the **Student Recreation Center** reports a high sense of belonging (*N = 828*), it also reports a relatively high sense of *not* belonging (*N = 733*).  

- **International students** most reported feeling a sense of belonging in the **EMU**, particularly the [Mills International Center](https://mills.uoregon.edu/) (*N = 22*). Apart from EMU-specific places, [Allen](https://journalism.uoregon.edu/about/facilities) was the second-most selected location for a sense of belonging (*N = 7*).  

- Graduate students most reported feeling a sense of belonging in the [cemetery](https://expo.uoregon.edu/spotlight/history-uo-architecture/feature/eugene-pioneer-cemetery) (*N = 10*).

## Defining Inclusiveness  

- We define **<span class="yellow-text">inclusiveness</span>** as when the *"belong"* count is high and the *"don’t belong"* count is low.  
- Because we ask students to identify places where they feel like they do and do not belong, another way of rank-ordering places is in terms of their overall inclusiveness.  
- That is, a place is **inclusive** to the extent that its *“belong”* click count is **high** and its *“don’t belong”* click count is **low**.

## Most Inclusive Locations  

- Considering the **percent of “belong” clicks** out of total clicks for the top six places with the most total clicks:  
  - [Erb Memorial Union (EMU)](https://emu.uoregon.edu) was by far the most **inclusive** (*Table 2*).  
  - [Knight Library](https://library.uoregon.edu/knight) ranked second and remained *solidly* inclusive.  
  - [University Housing](https://housing.uoregon.edu/) was *mostly* inclusive.  
  - [Lokey Science Complex](https://www.srgpartnership.com/project/lorry-i-lokey-laboratories/) and the [Student Recreation Center](https://rec.uoregon.edu/facilities) were *split* between belonging and not belonging.  
  - [Lillis Business Complex](https://business.uoregon.edu/about/lillis-complex) was **not** very inclusive.
