# Erb Memorial Union (EMU) Maps 

The Erb Memorial Union (EMU) is the hub of campus life and students engage in a range of activities throughout the EMU. 
While the campus maps examine sense of belonging across the full campus, these maps specifically look at locations within the EMU.
Students were asked to select places where they felt a sense of belonging as well as locations where they did not feel a strong sense of belonging.
Below you can find maps that show both sentiments. More on the methods can be found at the bottom of the page.
