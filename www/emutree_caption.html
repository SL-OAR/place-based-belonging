<p><b>Note:</b> Rectangle <span style="color: #11E8FF">size</span> represents a place's overall <span style="color: #11E8FF">popularity</span>, 
computed by <i>n</i> Belong + <i>n</i> Don't Belong.</p>

<p>Rectangle <span style="color: #11E8FF">color</span> represents a place's <span style="color: #11E8FF">inclusiveness</span>, 
which is a percentage indicating how inclusive a place is and is computed by:</p>

<p>
    <i>n</i> Belong / (<i>n</i> Belong + <i>n</i> Don't Belong) * 100.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Yellow</b> represents the high end of the inclusiveness continuum, and <b>black</b> represents the low end.
    <span style="color: gray;">Gray text</span> represents inclusiveness &gt; 75%.
</p>

<p>The criterion for inclusion of a place in the treemap was a total click count of at least 20.
The criterion for presenting a treemap was at least 4 places represented.
Additionally, all treemaps omit clicks on "Other" and "Out of Bounds" regions.</p>

<h4>Abbreviations:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>SSC</b> = Student Sustainability Center</li>
    <li><b>Hallway 1</b> = The East wing hallway on level 1 that runs in front of the Multicultural Center</li>
    <li><b>Hallway 2</b> = The East wing hallway on level 2 that runs in front of the Center for Student Involvement Resource Center and the Redwood Auditorium</li>
</ul>

<p>Because this overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years,
and because both places and methods have changed over time,
there is some inaccuracy in representing popularity and inclusiveness
(treemaps within academic years are accurate).</p>
