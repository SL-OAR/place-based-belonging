# Cloud Caption

**Note:** Word <span style="color: #11E8FF; font-weight: bold;">size</span> represents  
<span style="color: #11E8FF; font-weight: bold;">frequency</span> of keyword occurrence.

<span style="color: #11E8FF; font-weight: bold;">Hover over</span> words to see frequencies.

The criterion for inclusion of a keyword in the wordcloud was occurrence > 1.

If a word seems negatively valenced, it was very likely negated (e.g., preceded by the word "not").

Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once.

<span style="color: #11E8FF; font-weight: bold;">Across all places that were not subsequently aggregated 
into superordinate places and then disaggregated by subordinate places</span>  
(i.e., not Erb Memorial Union, Lokey Science Complex, or University Housing)  
<span style="color: #11E8FF; font-weight: bold;">as well as across sentiments</span>  
(i.e., "belong" and "don't belong"), most students contributed to only one wave of data collection,  
relatively few students contributed to two waves, and no one contributed to three waves.

Text data were annotated using the `udpipe` package.

Keywords were extracted using the **Rapid Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm**  
([Rose et al., 2010](https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/Eda0fgvF1VJAn2PPEU3c0xIBTrkNJIEnzOUzQhz6zaT5IA?e=FeHDYB){:target="_blank" style="color: #DF63A4;"}).

Wordcloud was generated using the `wordcloud2` package.

Colors were produced using the `rocket` palette of the `viridis` package.
