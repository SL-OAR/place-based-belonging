<p><b>Note:</b> Word <span style="color: #FEE11A ; font-weight: bold;">size</span> represents 
<span style="color: #FEE11A ; font-weight: bold;">frequency</span> of keyword occurrence.</p>

<p><span style="color: #FEE11A ; font-weight: bold;">Hover over</span> words to see frequencies.</p>

<p>The criterion for inclusion of a keyword in the wordcloud was occurrence &gt; 1.</p>

<p>If a word seems negatively valenced, it was very likely negated (e.g., preceded by the word "not").</p>

<p>Because analyses combine data from multiple academic years, some students contributed data more than once.</p>

<p><span style="color: #FEE11A ; font-weight: bold;">Across all places that were not subsequently aggregated 
into superordinate places and then disaggregated by subordinate places</span> 
(i.e., not Erb Memorial Union, Lokey Science Complex, or University Housing) 
<span style="color: #FEE11A ; font-weight: bold;">as well as across sentiments</span> 
(i.e., "belong" and "don't belong"), most students contributed to only one wave of data collection, 
relatively few students contributed to two waves, and no one contributed to three waves.</p>

<p>Text data were annotated using the <code>udpipe</code> package.</p>

<p>Keywords were extracted using the <b>Rapid Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm</b> 
(<a href="https://uoregon-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/clark13_uoregon_edu/Eda0fgvF1VJAn2PPEU3c0xIBTrkNJIEnzOUzQhz6zaT5IA?e=FeHDYB"

<p>Wordcloud was generated using the <code>wordcloud2</code> package.</p>

<p>Colors were produced using the <code>rocket</code> palette of the <code>viridis</code> package.</p>
