<p><b>Note:</b>The reasons tables are generated from the student responses to the question, "Why did you select that location?"</p>

<p>As part of the survey, students first selected the locations they felt the greatest sense of belonging and the least sense of belonging. 
After selecting locations students were asked why they selected those locations. 
The responses were then analyzed to uncover the key sentiments around words that were associated with greater sense of belonging and less sense of belonging. 
These tables, which are dividied into responses by building, are the raw responses from the students and can help give context for words observed in the word clouds, wordnets, and donut plots.</p>

<p>The sentences are all in lower case due to processing of the data but each location can be searched to unique responses containing specific words.</p>
