Places (Overall, not broken down by year unless specified) 

Overall, undergraduate students most frequently report feeling a sense of belonging in the Erb Memorial Union, with the Fishbowl being one of the most frequented locations. 

The only two University Housing locations that the number of students who report feeling like they don’t belong is larger than the number who report that they do are in places typically for graduate housing: Spencer View (17 belong, 54 not belong) and Grad Village (1 belong, 16 not belong). 

Apart from the EMU, the Rec Complex (N = 896) and the Knight Library (N = 839) come in second and third for student belonging. However, while the Student Recreation Center reports a high sense of belonging (N = 828), it also reports a relatively high sense of not belonging (N = 733). 

International students most reported feeling a sense of belonging in the EMU, particularly the Mills International Center (N = 22). Apart from EMU-specific places, Allen was second-most selected in relation to a sense of belonging (N = 7). Apart from the EMU, graduate students most reported feeling a sense of belonging in the cemetery (N = 10). 

We define inclusiveness as when the "belong” count is high and “don’t belong” is low. 

Because we ask students to identify places where they feel like they do and do not belong, another way of rank-ordering places is in terms of their overall inclusiveness. 
That is, a place is inclusive to the extent its “belong” click count is high and its “don’t belong” click count is low. 
Considering the percent of “belong” clicks out of total clicks for the top six places with the most total clicks 
(Erb Memorial Union, Knight Library, Lillis Business Complex, Lokey Science Complex, Student Recreation Center, and University Housing), 
the Erb Memorial Union was by far the most inclusive (Table 2). The Knight Library came in second, still solidly inclusive. University
Housing was mostly inclusive. The Lokey Science Complex and the Student Recreation Center were split. And the Lillis Business Complex was not so inclusive.
