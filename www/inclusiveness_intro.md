# Inclusiveness 

## Aggregated Bar Plots  
The aggregated bar plots show the inclusiveness of locations across campus. Inclusiveness for this project was defined as a percentage of responses that indicated they felt a sense of belonging in a space compared to overall responses for a location.   
The inclusiveness percentage was calculated by taking n clicks for belonging / total number of clicks for a location.

## Disaggregated Tree Maps  

The tree maps attempt to break up inclusiveness by location on campus. The figures show inclusiveness using the same formula but disaggregated. For the tree maps, the dark the color the more inclusive the location. Location titles that are in yellow indicate the place had an overall inclusiveness percentage of over 75%.
