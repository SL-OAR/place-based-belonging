# Word Clouds: 

The word clouds were generated using the student text responses to the question "Why did you select that location?".
After student's clicked a place on the map to indicate they felt a sense of belonging in that location or did not feel a sense of belonging in a location they were asked why. 
Those text responses were aggregated, split by word (removing filler words), 
and compiled to gather a general sentiment about a location for responses that indicated a greater sense of belonging and those that were associated with less of a sense of belonging. 
You can hover over the words to see the count of the word.
