spectrum represents a continuum from more to fewer clicks on a place, given total number of clicks. The red area are the locations with the highest density of clicks.</p>

<p>Number of clicks on a place &ge; 20 are displayed.</p>

<p>Color saturation and area of blobs are dependent on concentration in a general area, 
irrespective of regions drawn on a map, which can sometimes be inconsistent with quantification based on clicks in map regions.</p>

(i.e., 2021-22, 2020-21, 2019-20, 2018-19, and 2017-18 cohorts, respectively) US undergraduates contributed data, 
along with a few <i>n-year</i> students (i.e., a few from 2002-03, 2007-08, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2014-15, and 2016-17 cohorts) 
and US exchange undergraduates.</p>

<p><b>Additionally, the Erb Memorial Union map in Spring 2019 consisted of two vertically stacked images.</b> 
This produces blob distortion across images, and it results in invalid data; 
although students were instructed to select up to 3, some selected more than 3 places. 
For quantification of maps and other analyses, the first three recorded responses from these few students were used and the rest were discarded.</p>

<p>Heat map was originally produced in Qualtrics (30px radius, 35px blur), then click counts were overlaid on the heat map image using the <code>magick</code> package.</p>

<p>These are images of the maps produced.</p>
