# Disagg Tree Caption

**Note:** Rectangle <span style='color: #11E8FF'>size</span> represents a place's overall 
<span style='color: #11E8FF'>popularity</span>, computed by *n* Belong + *n* Don't Belong.  
Rectangle <span style='color: #11E8FF'>color</span> represents a place's 
<span style='color: #11E8FF'>inclusiveness</span>, calculated as:  
*n* Belong / (*n* Belong + *n* Don't Belong) × 100.

### Treemap Criteria
- **'Disaggregated'**: No combination of individual places into larger places  
  (e.g., residence halls not grouped into University Housing).  
- **'Less Delimited'**:  
  - Total click count ≥ 20 (less restrictive than 'More Delimited')  
  - Minimum of 4 places represented  
  - Clicks on Lawn, Other, and Out of Bounds regions are omitted

### Data Notes
Because the overall treemap combines data from multiple academic years and data collection methods have evolved, some inaccuracy in popularity and inclusiveness representation exists.  
- **Within-year treemaps:** Accurate  
- **International students' overall treemap:** Accurate despite combined data  

#### Examples:
- **Unthank Hall**:  
  - Did not exist before Spring 2022 data collection  
  - Popularity and inclusiveness may be underestimated  
- **Lokey Science Complex**:  
  - Shown in Spring 2018 as one entity  
  - Later years show disaggregated components
