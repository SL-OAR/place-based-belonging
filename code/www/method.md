# Supplemental Method

One aspect of belongingness worth attending to is that which is rooted in physical places. This is the
subject of ongoing study at the University of Oregon through the Student Wellbeing and Success
Initiative, a multicohort, longitudinal research program designed to holistically understand institutional
inputs to undergraduates’ wellbeing and success across the college experience. Each summer, we collect
baseline wellbeing data from the incoming cohort of undergraduate students. Each spring, we follow up
to see how students are doing. Over the last several follow-ups, we have been incrementally exploring
the notion of place-based belonging: the idea that people’s affinity for physical places, or lack thereof, is
intertwined with their sense of whether they fit in socially. This is a special case of the environmental
psychological concept of place attachment (Altman & Low, 1992), with conceptual focus on the place
dimension over the person or process dimensions (Scannell & Gifford, 2010) and content focus on social
meanings with which places are imbued as a subset of the general affective associations people have
with places. The methodology, however, is a significant departure from the traditional psychometric
approach of place attachment research (e.g., Williams, 2014; Williams & Vaske, 2003). Adapting
methods from (Pitcher & Royal, 2016), we ask students to click up to three places on a campus map they
feel like they “belong, fit in, are connected, are accepted, etc.,” and separately, to click up to three
places they feel like they “do not belong, do not fit in, are disconnected, are not accepted, etc.” This
generates data that allow us to do several things (for things not focused on here, see Clark & Bou
Malham, 2019).


The baseline portion of the research involved two main components: 1) wellbeing measurement and 2) social-psychological intervention. Typically, this was implemented in tandem with IntroDUCKtion sessions throughout the summer (mid June or early July - late September). Student Orientation Programs asked incoming students to complete baseline measurement approximately two weeks prior to their scheduled IntroDUCKtion sessions. However, because university operations were entirely different during Summer 2020, administration of baseline data collection was different. Rather than incrementally along with IntroDUCKtion sessions, Student Orientation Programs sent initial invitations all at once at the beginning of July. Handling of reminders to students who did not complete the measurement and intervention activities when asked was somewhat different each year. There were no reminders sent Summer 2018. The Office of Academic Advising sent email reminders periodically from early to mid-Summer 2019, sent a compressed burst of reminders in late Summer 2020, and sent an even more compressed burst of reminders in even later Summer 2021. Additionally, the Nontraditional Student Union invited and reminded transfer and nontraditional students to complete the activities all within that very late Summer 2021 window, as Student Orientation Programs did not communicate with those students earlier in the summer. In all years, the survey was closed just prior to the first day of Fall classes.

Measurements of constructs likely to be immediately affected by the social-psychological intervention (ability uncertainty, belonging uncertainty, and stereotype threat) were presented prior to the intervention, and all other measurements were presented after the intervention. Some students did not complete measurements presented after the intervention materials, which resulted in different sample sizes for analyses of constructs measured before and after presentation of intervention materials. Demographics items were also presented at the very end, which limited sample sizes somewhat further for analyses involving survey-specific demographics.

Procedures were somewhat different for students who were at least 18 years old and students who were under 18 years old among the 2018-19 cohort and initial data collection among the 2019-20 cohort (n = 580, which is 15% of the sample) than among later cohorts. When the baseline wave was first institutionalized in 2018-19, the primary focus was the educational program aspect (i.e., the intervention component). All students, regardless of age, were to participate as part of the process of becoming a student at the UO. The research program aspect (i.e., the wellbeing measurement component) was secondary. Because students under 18 years old could not consent to participating in the research aspect of the Initiative, given to how the consent protocol was initially structured, they did not participate in wellbeing measurement, generally. They participated in the intervention, completed a few general measurements (mostly manipulation checks, but one was excitement, which explains the notably larger df in models of excitement), and completed the set of demographics questions. Students who were at least 18 years old participated in all of the above plus the wellbeing measurements. After the first year (2018-19), it was clear that we needed to expand the assessment program aspect of the Initiative to better support developing the educational program aspect. Thus, the protocol was revised to have all students, regardless of age, participate in all aspects of baseline, and to use data for research purposes contributed only by students who were at least 18 years of age and thus able to consent. The new protocol was approved shortly after baseline 2019-20 had launched, hence the divided procedure for that cohort. The new protocol still resulted in massive loss of data that could be used for research (24% on average), however. Consequently, the protocol was revised again in 2021-22 to allow students under 18 years of age (about 99% of whom tend to be 17 years old at the time) to consent. The present document is within the assessment program aspect of the Initiative, because it is geared toward improving educational programs and practices. As such, all available data are used, regardless of student age or consent, and available data vary primarily because of the initial procedure change in 2019-20 and secondarily because of the variation in reminder implementation. The relevant consequence of this procedure variation for the present analysis is that only students who were at least 18 years old at the time of data collection were included in 2018-19 cohort data, students of any age were included in 2020-21 and 2021-22 cohort data, and there were likely slightly fewer students under age 18 in 2019-20 data than there might have been without a bifurcation of those procedures.
